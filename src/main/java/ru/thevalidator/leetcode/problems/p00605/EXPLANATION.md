#### Approach #1 Single Scan [Accepted]

The solution is very simple. We can find out the extra maximum number of flowers, **count**, that can be planted for the given **flowerbed** arrangement. To do so, we can traverse over all the elements of the **flowerbed** and find out those elements which are 0(implying an empty position). For every such element, we check if its both adjacent positions are also empty. If so, we can plant a flower at the current position without violating the no-adjacent-flowers-rule. For the first and last elements, we need not check the previous and the next adjacent positions respectively.

If the **count** obtained is greater than or equal to **n**, the required number of flowers to be planted, we can plant **n** flowers in the empty spaces, otherwise not.

**Implementation**

```Java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            // Check if the current plot is empty.
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                // Check if the left and right plots are empty.
                boolean emptyLeftPlot = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0);
                boolean emptyRightPlot = (i == flowerbed.length - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0);
                
                // If both plots are empty, we can plant a flower here.
                if (emptyLeftPlot && emptyRightPlot) {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count >= n;
    }
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: **O(n)**. A single scan of the **flowerbed** array of size **n** is done.
* Space complexity: **O(1)**. Constant extra space is used.

#### Approach #2 Optimized [Accepted]

**Algorithm**

Instead of finding the maximum value of **count** that can be obtained, as done in the last approach, we can stop the process of checking the positions for planting the flowers as soon as **count** becomes equal to **n**. Doing this leads to an optimization of the first approach. If **count** never becomes equal to **n**, **n** flowers can't be planted at the empty positions.

**Implementation**

```Java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canPlaceFlowers(int[] flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
            // Check if the current plot is empty.
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                // Check if the left and right plots are empty.
                boolean emptyLeftPlot = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0);
                boolean emptyRightPlot = (i == flowerbed.length - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0);
                
                // If both plots are empty, we can plant a flower here.
                if (emptyLeftPlot && emptyRightPlot) {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    count++;
                    if (count >= n) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count >= n;
    }
}
```
